## Awesome Deep Learning 2016

Year 2016 has been a busy year with a lot of progress and updates in in deep learning. The area continues to recieve a lot of attention among
researchers and industry giants side-by-side. I would like to thank everyone for their great efforts and hardwork. As a sign of gratitude, I would like to create
this list of some of the most signficant accomplishments and new achievements that happened in 2016 in the area of Deep Learning.

In Jan 2016, DeepMind -the deep learning company which is based in london and was acquired by Google in 2014- published a nature paper [Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search] "(http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html) which describes a computer program named AlphaGo which can play the ancient game Go by combining deep neural networks and montecarlo tree-search. They also announced that they are planning a match between Lee Sedol, one of the world top Go Players and their artificial intelligence program which is programmed using deep reinforcement learning. The match consisted of 5 rounds that concluded in March 2016, with Alpha Go beating Sedol 4-1.
